# Code Reading Club - Session Lecture de Code +  Modelisation de la Connaissance du Modèle Cognitif
# agenda

## Durée totale (120 mins)

Vous aurez besoin de:

- a printed copy of the code for the club and coloured pens, crayons or pencils

    -or-

- an electronic means of scribbling on a code PDF (e.g. a tablet and tablet pen or PDF annotation software)

## Why are we doing this?

Take a few minutes to talk about your motivation for doing the club. This is important because it will help you support each other and make it more likely that your group will feel that the club sessions have value for them.


## First glance

The goal of this exercise is to practice to get a first impression of code and to act upon that. We all have different instincts and strategies for where to start when faced with a new piece of code. It doesn't matter how trivial you think the first and second things you noticed are.

### (1 min) Independently - Glance at the code

It's important that is an immediate reaction.

* Right away, note down the first thing that catches your eye.
* Then note down the second thing that catches your eye.
* Take the remainder of the minute to think about why you noticed those things first.

### (5 mins) Together - Discuss the results

Talk about why things might have jumped out for different people. It might be tempting for some people to start talking about the big picture; try to steer discussion back to individual details, rather than summaries.

* How do those initial observations help with deciding what to look at next?
* What lines or facts or concepts were chosen by everyone versus by only a few people?

Reflect also on what kind of knowledge you used in this exercise:

* Knowledge of the domain, of the programming language? Of a framework?
* What knowledge do you think might be needed to better understand this code?


## Connaissance de la structure du code

### (5 mins) Independently - Notez les éléments de syntaxe:

* avec lesquels vous êtes familiers
* qui vous semblent peu clair ou confus

 > Le rôle de chaque bloc de texte est-il clair pour vous ?
 > Reconnaissez vous tous les opérateurs
 > Prenez le reste du temps pour réfléchir aux autres éléments qui ne vous sont pas familiers.

### (5 mins) Together - Discuss

  * 

## Code structure

The goal of this exercise is to be a concrete thing to *do* when looking at new code for the first time. New code can be scary, doing something will help! Digital annotation can take a bit longer than on paper. Leave time for your group members to settle on a technique that works for them.

### (12 mins) Independently - Examine structure

Variables

* Go through the code and circle all variables in red
* Then draw a link between variables and their uses

Function / method calls

* Go through the code and circle all methods in blue
* Then draw a link between methods and their invocations

Instantiation

* Go through the code and circle all instances of classes in green
* Then draw a link between classes and their instances

### (10 mins) Together - Discuss the results

* Did anyone have trouble deciding what constituted a variable, function or class?
* What patterns are visible from the colors and links only?
* How does the data flow through the code?
* What parts of the code seem to warrant more attention?

## Content

The goal of this exercise is to start to think about which lines in the code define its essence, have the biggest impact or need to be paid close attention to.


### (5 mins) Together - Note down all variable/class/method names

As a group, go through the code mechanically and *create a list of all identifier names* in the snippet. This can be done with one person scribing while others call out. If you have done the "examine structure" exercise before, this should be relatively quick and easy; but sometimes, you will need short discussions to agree on things.

### (10 mins) Together - Discuss

* What can we learn from these names / words / verbs ?
* Which elements are related to each other, from the names only?
* Are there names that are ambiguous when looked at without context?

 '>>>>>>>>> long discussion about if we keep the part about "important lines" or not <<<<<<<<<<<<<

## Business Language and Context (free form)

### (10 mins) Independently - Contextualize and try to Correlate

*  given the words you consider most important,  think if you are familiar with those words, if they make sense for you, 
how you understand them, especially if you make any asumption about those words, if the context is clear for you or if you need clarification.
*  organize in a free form (drawing, grah, or simply sentences) how you would put the words according to their meaning and their context.

### (5 mins) Together - Discuss

Discuss in the group:

* words covered by many people?
* words that seems not clear / ambiguous / not relevant
* is there one or several context(s) that may arise ?


## Business Language Model (graph form)

### (10 mins) Groups - Represent as a conceptual graph

* using potatoes and lines, group words and name relationships between the words you've choosen.
* relationships are free form; they can be of any type, even unconvential ones. For example: is-a, is-related-to, is-close-to, has-elements, 
    is-out-of-knowledge, is-an-alien ...
    
 At the end, we expect to observe a graph that contains an expression of the ubiquitous language, through the names of "entities" as well the names used in relationships labels.   


## Summary

The goal of this exercise is to think about the shifts observed between a problem space and its solution space(s).

### (10 mins) Together - Discuss

* tbd
* strategies used to create the Business Language Model (e.g. method names, documentation, variable names, prior knowledge of system)

## Reflect on the session

If you have time, it's helpful to wrap up the session with a little reflection

### (5 mins) Together - note down things about the session

* that went well or felt good
* you want to try to do differently next time because they didn't work or felt bad
